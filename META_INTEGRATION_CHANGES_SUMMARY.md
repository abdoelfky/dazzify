# Meta Integration Fix - Summary of Changes

## Problem Identified
The Meta SDK (flutter_meta_sdk) package was added to `pubspec.yaml` but was **not initialized or implemented** in the application code. This meant that no events were being sent to Meta Dashboard when users downloaded or used the app.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created Meta SDK Service Layer
**File**: `lib/core/services/meta_sdk_service.dart` (NEW)
- Created a singleton service class to manage all Meta SDK operations
- Provides methods for tracking app events, user actions, and conversions
- Includes error handling to prevent app crashes if SDK fails

### 2. Initialized Meta SDK in App Startup
**File**: `lib/main.dart`
- Added import for `MetaSdkService`
- Added Meta SDK initialization in `main()` function
- SDK now initializes when app starts and logs app activation event

### 3. Integrated with Authentication Flow
**File**: `lib/features/auth/logic/auth_cubit.dart`
- Added Meta SDK tracking when new users complete registration
- Logs app install event (first-time user)
- Logs registration completion event
- Sets user data (email, name) for advanced matching

### 4. Integrated with User Profile Management
**File**: `lib/features/user/logic/user/user_cubit.dart`
- Sets user ID when user profile loads (for existing users)
- Sets user data for advanced matching
- Clears user data when account is deleted

### 5. Integrated with Logout Flow
**File**: `lib/features/shared/logic/tokens/tokens_cubit.dart`
- Clears Meta SDK user data when user logs out
- Ensures user privacy and proper data management

### 6. iOS Platform Configuration
**File**: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- Added `CFBundleURLTypes` with Facebook URL scheme for deep linking
- Added `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to query Facebook apps
- Already had Facebook App ID and Client Token configured

### 7. Android Platform Configuration
**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Added Facebook package queries for deep linking
- Already had Facebook App ID and Client Token configured in meta-data

### 8. Documentation
**Files Created**:
- `META_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `META_INTEGRATION_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`: This summary file

## Events Now Being Tracked

### Automatically Tracked Events
1. **App Activation** - Every time app is opened
2. **App Install** - First time a new user registers
3. **Registration Completion** - When new user completes sign-up

### User Tracking
- User ID is set after login
- User data (email, name, phone) is tracked for advanced matching
- User data is properly cleared on logout/deletion

## What You'll See in Meta Dashboard

After deploying these changes, you will see:

1. **App Events**
   - `fb_mobile_activate_app` - App opens
   - `fb_mobile_first_time_purchase` - New installs
   - `fb_mobile_complete_registration` - User registrations

2. **User Attribution**
   - User IDs linked to Meta accounts
   - Advanced matching for better attribution

3. **Conversion Tracking**
   - Installation conversions
   - Registration conversions
   - User engagement metrics

## Important Notes

### Timeline
- Test events appear immediately in Meta Events Manager (Test Events)
- Production events take **24-48 hours** to appear in dashboard
- Attribution data may take up to 72 hours to stabilize

### Testing
1. Enable Test Events in Meta Events Manager
2. Add your test device
3. Install and use the app
4. Verify events in Test Events dashboard

### Next Steps (Optional)
Consider adding tracking for:
- Purchase/booking completion events
- Content view events (vendor/service views)
- Search events
- Add to cart/wishlist events

See `MetaSdkService` class for available methods.

## Files Modified

### New Files

## Verification Steps

Before deploying:
1. ✅ Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. ✅ Build iOS: `flutter build ios --release`
3. ✅ Build Android: `flutter build appbundle --release`
4. ✅ Test on physical device
5. ✅ Verify events in Meta Events Manager Test Events

After deploying:

## Support

If events are not appearing in Meta Dashboard:
1. Verify Facebook App ID and Client Token are correct
2. Check that app is approved in Meta Business Manager
3. Ensure Test Events are configured during testing
4. Allow 24-48 hours for production events to appear
